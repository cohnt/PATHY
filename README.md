PATHY is a maze solving software, using various algorithms and image processing techniques to solve a maze from an image. PATHY was implemented using C# and Unity3D. The maze solving algorithms were initially implemented in C++, and then ported to C#.

Currently supported algorithms:
- Dijkstra's Algorithm/Breadth First Search
- A*
- "Right hand wall following" Algorithm
